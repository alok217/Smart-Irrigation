 researchers at the University of Georgia and University of Maine have been studying the water needs of annuals and perennials. The good news is that many plants need much less water than most people expect


 We have developed an irrigation system that can water plants when needed with the appropriate amount of water. This system uses sensors to measure substrate moisture. Soil moisture sensors have become available that are relatively inexpensive ($60), reliable and low maintenance.

Among these new sensors are EC-5 and 10HS soil moisture sensors from Decagon Devices Inc. The EC-5 sensor works well in 4-, 5- and 6-inch pots. The 10HS sensor is suitable for container sizes of 6-inch and larger.

Another approach to using soil moisture sensors for irrigation control is to use them like a cut-off switch. A timer can be set to water at a specific time. At that time the irrigation valve opens only if the sensors detect that the substrate water content is below a designated set point. If the substrate is still moist, the sensor prevents the irrigation valve from opening. If the sensor does allow irrigation to occur, it can then turn off the irrigation automatically when the set point for substrate water content is reached.

n many cases, the sensors can be connected to computerized greenhouse control systems to directly control irrigation. Sensor operation is simple. When a plant is transpiring, it takes up water from the substrate, which dries out. Since the sensor measures the substrate water content frequently, the greenhouse environmental computer notices when the substrate water content drops below a particular set point and can turn on the irrigation system. The duration of the irrigation period can be either a set amount of time or it can be sensor-controlled. For example, the irrigation system can be turned on when the substrate water content drops below 40 percent and turned off when it has reached 45 percent.
